                            <p>NAD catalogs general information on many novels written by those of African Descent.  Such information includes basic novel bibliography, an author profile, novel style, subjects, and contributor information. It is not intended to be exhaustive by including every novel that has ever been written. However, NAD attempts to catalog those novels throughout the African diaspora that are literary in nature and where the author has had some critical acclaim. Please note that self-published novels are not included in the catalog at this time. <br>

                            A novel is selected based primarily on its author's critical acclaim: Has readership and scholarly attention warranted its inclusion? This is the primary question I asked as I consulted scholarly texts on the African American novel, Postcolonial Novels, and reputable research centers on literary culture around the world.  Every novel written by a person of African descent  will not make it into this catalog in phase one. However, with additional vetting and suggestions as NAD grows, it is possible that we will eventually include previously excluded novels.</p>

                            <p>Uzzie T. Cannon is an English Professor specializing in African American literature and culture.  She  developed NAD as a digital humanities project while at Loyola University Chicago.  Given her research focus in 20th and 21st Century African American men's fiction, she found it hard to create projects that involved non-copyrighted materials. So she decided to work with what she could in the form of bibliographic information and some full-etexts novels to craft a catalog and data visualization tools. With a love of novels, knowledge in website design, and new skills in digital humanities, Cannon decided to create Novels of the African Diaspora to expose others to the novels of those throughout the African Diaspora and to give scholars a way of establishing new directions in comparative research.</p>

                          <h4 class="media-heading">Technical</h4><p>NAD is a web application designed to facilitate the comparative study of literary novels written by novelists of African descent throughout the Diaspora.  Built around a database and developed with client-side design tools, the application catalogs the metadata of over 300+ novels and offers general readers and scholars search and data visualization tools to collect data on the literary works. Users will be able to collect data by querying the catalog's database and formulating results through range-finders, various charts and graphs, and maps. From the catalog data and the data sets created with the tools, users will gain knowledge about the various novels that exist and will be able to examine the interconnectedness of these works based on the bibliographic and subject content. It will allow users to formulate research questions to collectively examine and understand the development and evolution of novels written by those of African descent throughout the world.</p>

                            <p> The resources used to build the NAD catalog include the bio-bliographical sourcebooks<emp> African American Authors, 1745-1945</emp> and <emp>Contemporary African American Novelists </emp> edited by Emmanuel S. Nelson; the Ringshout website; the African Studies Center in Leiden website; and my very own bookshelves full of novels from novelist of African dewcent whose works I have taught over the years. One crucial part for the growth of NAD is the crowdsourcing for metadata contained in the catalog.  There are thousands of literary novels that have been written, so attempting to catalog all of them is a serious feat. The actual entry for each novel is crowdsourced from scholars, students, and librarians through the ??? list- serve and from personal teaching colleagues from various literary department sround the world.</p>
